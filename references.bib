abstract = {A complete mathematical model of SCARA robot was developed and presented in this paper including servomotor dynamics and dynamics simulation. The equations of motion were derived by using Lagrangian mechanics. Direct current (DC) servomotor driving each robot joint was studied and modelled. SCARA robot was constructed to achieve drilling operation using solid dynamics (SD) software. The performance of the robot-actuator system was examined with solid dynamic simulation and verified with MATLAB/Simulink. The results of simulations were discussed. The facilities of the programmes (investigate, design, visualise, and test an object even if it does not exists) used for kinematic and dynamic simulation of robot systems were emphasised.

@article{Kaleli2013,
abstract = {Robotic manipulators on a moving base are used in many industrial and transportation applications. In this study, the modelling of a RRP SCARA-type serial manipulator on a moving base is presented. A Lagrange-Euler approach is used to obtain the complete dynamic model of the moving-base manipulator. Hence, the dynamic model of the manipulator and the mobile base are expressed separately. In addition, Virtual Instrumentation (VI) is developed for kinematics, dynamics simulation and animation of the manipulator combined with the moving-base system. Using the designed VI in LabView, the relationship between frequency of disturbances of the moving base and joint torques is investigated. The obtained results are presented in graphs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Kaleli et al.; licensee InTech.},

The equations of motion are derived by using Lagrangian mechanics. Dc servo motors driving each robot joint is studied with PD controller action. Serpent 1 robot is instructed to achieve pick and place operations of three different size cylindirical objects through assigned holes. The performance of robot-actuator-control system is examined with numerical simulation and experimentally verified. The results of experimentation are given with comments.
